# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

This is not really a react native application although it was meant to be one. My computer where I run React Native is not working therefore I hade to get a computer and this one I cant run React Native on. I have done the project in React.js which can easily be converted to RN. My Todos:

# TODOS:

- Clean the code base
- Specify better the TS part.
- API calls work but I would want to seperate Logic from View in order to get a better structure.
- Did not really understand the game but I am currently missing a higher/lower functionality. Thought of proccess would be comparing the guess with the previous card value to determine whether is was higher or lower.
- Styling is missing
